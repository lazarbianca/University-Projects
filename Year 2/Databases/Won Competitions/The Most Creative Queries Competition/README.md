## The Most Creative Queries Competition
Task: Submit an interesting, original query; it must be useful to a potential user.

I won this competition with a query that accomplishes the following:
- Returns info about the Researchers who have made Observations on planets which are orbited by EXPLORED satellites
- Only if those Observations were made PRIOR to the earliest exploration date of ANY of its satellites.
- It also returns the Number of such Observations
Obs: it is irrelevant if multiple researchers wrote observations on the same planet
