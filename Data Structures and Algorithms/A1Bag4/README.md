## Dynamic Array
  
Implement in C++ the given container (ADT) using a given representation and a dynamic array
as a data structure. You are not allowed to use the vector from STL or from any other library.  
**Obs**:  
- Since your implementation will use dynamic allocation, it is a good practice to implement a 
destructor, copy constructor and assignment operator as well (even if they are not on the 
interface).  
- You are not allowed to use the functions memcpy and realloc, because it is not safe to use 
memcpy and realloc on memory that was allocated with new. Also, if the memory location 
contains objects, undefined behavior can occur. The implementation might still work with 
these functions, but it is not a good practice to use them.  
- If you need auxiliary functions, fell free to add them to the interface of the ADT, but make 
them private.  
  
**_4. ADT Bag_** â€“ represented using a dynamic array of <element, frequency> pairs (or two 
dynamic arrays).  
For example, the bag [5, 10, -1, 2, 3, 10, 5, 5, -5] will be represented as [(5,3), (10, 2), (-1, 1), 
(2, 1), (3, 1), (-5, 1)]
